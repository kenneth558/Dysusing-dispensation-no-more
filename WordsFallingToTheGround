"   He let none of Samuelâ€™s words fall to the ground."  1 Samuel 3:19

A reminder to all of us that our words, though they contain the power of death and life, might be powerless for good if the Lord is not supportive of the one speaking.
"Without me ye can do nothing" John 15:5 is another witness to this fact.
